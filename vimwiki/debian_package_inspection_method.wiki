A Debian package is basically an ar archive containing two compressed tarfiles, control.tar.gz and data.tar.gz (possibly using 
a different compression method and corresponding extension). The second contains the complete filesystem tree of the package 
and the first the packaging meta-files. That's mostly a header with a general package description (called control) and the 
so-called package maintainer scripts which will be run at various phases of the install with certain arguments (as documented 
in the Debian Policy Manual).

Besides the option of disassembling the archive manually, the dpkg-deb command can be used to access the contents. Assuming a 
package file named uselessd_1.52.11_amd64.deb, the command

dpkg-deb --fsys-tarfile uselessd_1.52.11_amd64.deb | tar tvf -

would enable examining the contents of the data archive and

dpkg-deb -I uselessd_1.52.11_amd64.deb postinst

would extract the postinstall configuration script to stdout.
