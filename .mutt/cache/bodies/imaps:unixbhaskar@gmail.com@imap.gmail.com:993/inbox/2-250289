Give people a tool, some of them will make more use of it than you might
like. I do my best to push back against excessive markup (which all of the
above qualifies as, as far as I'm concerned), but I can't really even do
that will all that goes through my tree, much less all the docs stuff
merged by others.

The markup in question was seemingly added by Neil; I've added him to CC
in case he wants to comment on it.

I'm not sure what to do other than to continue to push for minimal use of
intrusive markup.
