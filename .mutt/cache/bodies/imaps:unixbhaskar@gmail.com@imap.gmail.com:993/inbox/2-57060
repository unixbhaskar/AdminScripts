Patka da,

As dimensions in data storage and retrieval is going to an unanticipated
heights presently, I've come across a requirement to set up Apache Hadoop
in a Linux Cluster. I'm very sure that I would come across difficulties as
I have last worked on Linux environment 5-8 years ago and that too in labs
as a part of my MCA paper :(

Please keep yourself available and prompt to my (may be stupid) questions
that is surely going to be lining up your way for the coming couple of
months :)

Thanks, boss!!
Buro
