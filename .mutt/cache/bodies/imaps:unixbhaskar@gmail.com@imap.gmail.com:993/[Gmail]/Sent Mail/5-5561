Thanks, you are not doing it either. Your respose has nothing to ponder
about. You haven't read my mail properly...could you do it again??
Sometimes reading twice helps.=20

I am not looking here for a "copu-paste" answer...I know what I am doing
=2E.people I have addressed are much aware of me than you.=20

Don't you think I have given enough details to visualize the situation,
it is quite commin though.=20

Anyway, I understand where you come from...one little
suggestion...before you pass your wise suggestion kindly search and
understand where peoplae came from and what they do.
