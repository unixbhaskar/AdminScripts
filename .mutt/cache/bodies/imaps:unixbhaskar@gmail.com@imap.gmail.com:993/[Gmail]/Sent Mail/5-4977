Well, I am not sure I can be great help , but I believe you are stationed i=
n MOhali and can not go out, is that true? If it is true, I would suggest=
=20
you to look for some local people who are involve in that matter.

I am not sure whether MOhali has a LUG or not, you might search out for tha=
t, if that is exists , then try to reach our people who actively particiapa=
ting in that LUG, they might be a great help .=20

Anyway, in our country internship thought and viewed in different way and c=
hances are pretty limited. I don't want sound passimist , but that's the tr=
uth.

Good luck.

Thanks,
Bhaskar
