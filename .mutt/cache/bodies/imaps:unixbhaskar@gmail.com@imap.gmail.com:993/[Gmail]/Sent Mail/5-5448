Well, look at kernelci.org ..sure few of the stuff you mentioned not yet
covered, but they are heading there . As like every other thing it takes
time to be there.

BTW "safe language" ..sound pretty odd ..what do you mean by that?? I
know lot of infomation float arounf and most of them are garbage.

Al, do you have any clue what the "safe language" is ? Why two different
language interplay in a single project?? What benefit does it bring into
platter??=20

Look like I am missing so very obvious stuff...please flame me with your
enlighten information.
