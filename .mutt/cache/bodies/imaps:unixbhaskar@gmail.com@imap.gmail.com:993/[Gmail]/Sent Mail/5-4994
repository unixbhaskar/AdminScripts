Thanks, Alice for the note. I do but I am an out and out infrastructure
person.I do/did manage infra running on GNU/Linux and related team. Kind
of advance level of OPS role.=20

If you can manage to hold on that kind of role , whether it's remote or
on site(which you have to process my working permit or visa) . Then, I
shall be perfectly alright for that kind of role.

Nope , I am not interested in any sort of "Development" role.

Thanks,
Bhaskar
