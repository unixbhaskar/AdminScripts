Honestly, your questionire doesn't make any sense. I am not sure is that
way you people hire people??=20

Look, free-consulting is not my forte nor I am willing. If you come to
me straight way cooeprate with you people.

I have been in the industry for long enough and seen enough...this kind
of stuff doesn't cut through..honestly. Yup, you can get away with this
policy with "needy" and "inexperinace" people(India is flooded with
those), qualified monkeys) .

I saw your advertisement( and I completely forgot what I saw) and felt I
could help.

Well, I am looking out for an long term employeer but not at the cost of
some practice ,which I don't approve.

You might pick up the phone and talk to me ,if you are confused what I
have written above, so I clarify your thorught process.

Thank you so much for your attention.=20
