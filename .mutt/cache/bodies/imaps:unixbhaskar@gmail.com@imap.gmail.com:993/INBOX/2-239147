So this has been on my mind for a bit and the clone() bug here brought
this up again. I think it would be good if we could have a consensus
that all new system calls with flag arguments should default to
unsigned int as long as the flag argument is passed in a register; maybe
we could even change most legacy syscalls to unsigned int if safe. It's
not very transparent to userspace when looking at kernel sources why
system calls use unsigned long, int, or unsigned int and I doubt there's
much reason to it anyway apart from historical. But maybe I'm wrong;
that's not unusual. Or maybe it's not worth it. But I've been mulling
putting that into the extensible syscall design patch Aleksa and
I wrote and sent out a while ago:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-doc/20191002151437.5367-1-christian.brauner@ubuntu.com/
right after copy_struct_from_user() landed. Maybe it's worth resending.

Right.

Yeah, of course.

That's very Wizard of Oz: "Pay no attention to the macro behind the
syscall declaration"; which means now I really _want_ to look at it. :)
