Yeah I want to be clear I'm not talking about this years conference, I'm talking 
about future conferences and if/how we want to make changes.

I picked plumbers because by-in-large the overlap between plumbers attendance 
and LSFMMBPF attendance is pretty large, but obviously it doesn't have to be 
just that.  Ted and others have suggested having a larger more inclusive 
conference opposite of plumbers, which I think is a really cool idea.  Thanks,

Josef
