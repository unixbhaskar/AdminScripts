Yeah.  perl ain't c.

And this discussion has been had many times.

Here's one from 2009
https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/12/15/490

Another from 2012
https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/2/5/141

Line lengths checks are normally pretty silly.

Hard limits at 80 really don't work well, especially with
some of the 25+ character length identifiers used today.

I think a line length warning at 132 is generally reasonable
but it could depend on complexity and identifier lengths.

That deep indentation test already exists at 6 tabs.
Maybe it should be 5 instead.  Or maybe even 4, but
that's a pretty easy to need and common use case.

Tab depth use in the kernel is more or less

$ git grep -Poh '^\t+(if|do|while|for|switch)\b' | \
  sed -r 's/\w+//g' | \
  awk '{print length($0);}' | \
  sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

trivial btw: VT100s were 80x24 or 132x24, PCs were 80x25
