What if you introduce to the above litmus test:

P2(int *x) { *x = 2; }

How can a developer, using the LKMM as a reference, hope to prove
their code is free from data races without having to enumerate all
possible values a variable could contain (in addition to all possible
interleavings)?

I view introducing data value dependencies, for the sake of allowing
more programs, to a language memory model as a slippery slope, and am
not aware of any precedent where this worked out. The additional
complexity in the memory model would put a burden on developers and
the compiler that is unlikely to be a real benefit (as you pointed
out, the compiler may even need to disable some transformations). From
a practical point of view, if the LKMM departs further and further
from C11's memory model, how do we ensure all compilers do the right
thing?

My vote would go to explicit annotation, not only because it reduces
hidden complexity, but also because it makes the code more
understandable, for developers and tooling. As an additional point, I
find the original suggestion to add WRITE_ONCE to be the least bad (or
some other better named WRITE_). Consider somebody changing the code,
changing the semantics and the values written to "non_rcu". With a
WRITE_ONCE, the developer would be clear about the fact that the write
can happen concurrently, and ensure new code is written with the
assumption that concurrent writes can happen.
