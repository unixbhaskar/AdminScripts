We have no chance to kill the existing ones off, but we certainly can stop
accepting new ones.  I would make an exception for struct iovec arrays
passed as an argument, provided that the data they refer to is opaque,
and while pselect6() kind of kludges are bloody revolting, they might
be inevitable in some cases - not without a very good explanation from
their authors, though, and "I wanna have 18 arguments; whaddya mean, don't?!"
is not one.
