Latency can be more unpleasant, actually - you try to discuss something between
3 people, when one is in .uk, another - in .us (east coast) and the third one -
in ,au (also east coast).  Timezone deltas - 5 hours and 8 hours, in opposite
directions...  Incidentally, that was about mount, with me and David being
two of participants; I somewhat hoped to get that sorted out at LSF, but Ian
won't be there anyway.  OTOH, that's just an 8 hours delta...
