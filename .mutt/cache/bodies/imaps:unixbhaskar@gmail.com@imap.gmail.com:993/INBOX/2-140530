Hi

Last week I finished the work to get altarch content pushed via
cbs.centos.org to buildlogs as a first step towards wider release
options opening up. Today the scripts are in production and I've
incldued the list below to indicate content currently in that push
queue. It should be publicly visible in a few minutes time.

What this means is that for any tag, where the SIG has requested push
- - we can now support aarch64, ppc64, ppc64le, armhfp and i386 content
built, tested and delivered via the public community services (
cbs.centos.org / ci.centos.org / buildlogs.centos.org ) and then
signed released via whatever delivery mechanism is already in place (
isos, disk media, cloud images, containers, livemedia, rpm repos,
vagrant boxs etc ).

There are still a few considerations to work through on the build side
however. There is no clear path within our existing buildsystem ( koji
) to work with similar content, only different by the intendant target
architecture and how the relationships work between build's and
status'. Thomas, Brian and I spent an evening last week working
through some of these options, and I believe Thomas is going to
re-iterate the options in the coming days and we'll need to work
through those and arrive at whatever makes most sense in the immediate
future - and work on a bigger/better plan longer term.

What I do recommend is going through the previous threads on this
subject on the centos-devel list ( and there have been a few ), so as
to update yourself on the concerns ( they remain largely unchanged,
just a lot more thought and understanding now exists for some of them,
atleast from my side ).

Regards,

Hello Nico,

many thanks for your detailed feedback.

I assume only the first connection would be affected by the reverse DNS 
delay, since it would probably be cached afterwards?  Based on this 
assumption, and since Vagrant connects to the VM each time it boots, I 
performed some measurements with "time vagrant up" (from a powered-off 
state, after "vagrant halt").  Here are the stats from 10 measurements 
for each configuration, "UseDNS no" in both cases, but default 
parameters for sshd, and with -u0 enabled:

               mean       variance       median
default       76.7526    8.44587        75.4725
with -u0      75.3307    0.353426       75.3235

The values are in seconds.  The big variance in the default case is due 
to two outliers, 84.559s and 78.41s.  The boot time is more predictable 
with -u0, and we seem to save about 150ms from the boot time.

>> IV. disable requiretty in /etc/sudoers

I am aware of the security trade-off.  As Ken wrote, Ansible apparently 
doesn't need requiretty to be disabled any more, although their 
documentation hasn't been updated yet to reflect this.  I'm going to 
leave requiretty as it is, enabled by default.

At least with the VirtualBox provider, you can have a visible VM by 
setting v.gui=true in the Vagrantfile.  I reduced the grub timeout to 1, 
instead of 0, to allow for manual intervention if necessary, when 
debugging boot problems.

Best regards,
Lauren?iu

Just trying to resurrect that thread :-)

We have a new OpsTools SIG (see
http://www.karan.org/blog/2016/07/11/welcoming-the-opstool-sig/) that
will probably depend on pkgs coming from configmgmt SIG soon, so we
should build those pkgs in our tags, and then they'll be able to
tag/import those builds in their repositories

The tags in CBS/Koji are indeed created for Puppet and Ansible (see
https://cbs.centos.org/koji/search?match=glob&type=tag&terms=config*)
but it seems nobody tried to build a pkg (yet).
What is needed to start building pkgs through cbs ?

People representing the Salt/Rudder/Chef communities can create a bug
report like this one : https://bugs.centos.org/view.php?id=10604 to also
have their tags created.

I'd like at least to have feedback from everybody in the SIG to confirm
that their cbs access works fine (so basically `cbs moshimoshi` at
minimum) (see https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/CommunityBuildSystem)

If a member listed on
https://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/ConfigManagementSIG has
trouble accessing CBS/Koji, or troubles with his ACO
(https://accounts.centos.org), feel free to reach Julien or me to help you.

As a reminder, the ConfigMgmt SIG has actually no irc meeting, as it
seems it was impossible to find a common time slot that suited
everybody. So we have then to use intensively the centos-devel list for
this.

Let us know how we can help you

Subject: [CentOS-devel] Question about authoritative SIG for specific
	pkg[s] (wrt ConfigMgmt SIG)
Message-ID: <578497FC.30407@centos.org>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"

I  just had a look at CBS and was wondering how one SIG (so not
ConfigMgmt SIG specific, but let's use that as an example) can interact
with other SIGs.

One example is Ansible : it seems some other SIGs are relying on it and
so actually the ConfigMgmgt SIG isn't able to build it as it's already
built with the same ENVR but in a different target/tag :
https://cbs.centos.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=1947

What would be the option for this ?
Actually the direct option is for the ConfigMgmt SIG to just tag that
build (for example for ansible-2.1.0.0-1.el7) so that it will appear in
the correct repositories, but I'm wondering if such SIG wouldn't have to
be considered "authoritative" and so having to discuss/bump/build new
releases, and then other SIGs can just consume/tag a specific build/ENVR
they want in their own repositories.

Are there any update regarding this SIG?
