Maybe base the sleep on the bdi write speed? We can't feasibly tell you
if something is congested. It used to sort of work on things like sata
drives, since we'd get congested when we hit the queue limit and that
wasn't THAT far off with reality. Didn't work on SCSI with higher queue
depths, and certainly doesn't work on NVMe where most devices have very
deep queues.

Or we can have something that does "sleep until X requests/MB have been
flushed", something that the vm would actively call. Combined with a
timeout as well, probably.

For the vm case above, it's further complicated by it being global
state. I think you'd be better off just making the delay smaller.  100ms
is an eternity, and 10ms wakeups isn't going to cause any major issues
in terms of CPU usage. If we're calling the above wait_iff_congested(),
it better because we're otherwise SOL.
