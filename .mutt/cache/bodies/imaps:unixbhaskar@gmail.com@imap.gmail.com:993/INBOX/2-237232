We probably can.   After introducing a kernel_compat_siginfo that is
the size that userspace actually would need.

It isn't something I want to mess with until this code gets merged, as I
think the set_fs cleanups are more important.


Christoph made some good points about how ugly the #ifdefs are in
the generic copy_siginfo_to_user32 implementation.

I am thinking the right fix is to introduce.
	- TS_X32 as a companion to TS_COMPAT in the x86_64.
        - Modify in_x32_syscall() to test TS_X32
        - Implement x32_copy_siginfo_to_user32 that forces TS_X32 to be
          set. AKA:
        
	        x32_copy_siginfo_to_user32()
	        {
	        	unsigned long state = current_thread_info()->state;
	                current_thread_info()->state |= TS_X32;
	                copy_siginfo_to_user32();
	                current_thread_info()->state = state;
	        }

That would make the #ifdefs go away, but I don't yet know what the x86
maintainers would say about that scheme.  I think it is a good path as
it would isolate the runtime cost of that weird SIGCHLD siginfo format
to just x32.  Then ia32 in compat mode would not need to pay.

Once I get that then it will be easier to introduce a yet another helper
of copy_siginfo_to_user32 that generates just the kernel_compat_siginfo
part, and the two visible derivatives can call memset and clear_user
to clear the unset parts.

I am assuming you don't don't mind having a full siginfo in
elf_note_info that ultimately gets copied into the core dump?
