I think we can. I spent quite some effort on splitting up the syscall
entry/exit stuff so only the low level entry up to the point where RCU
is watching and the low level exit where RCU is evtl. going back to idle
plus the related ASM maze. It's quite some tedious work, that's why I
came up with the section approach.

Yes, the break point stuff is unique, but it has nicely demonstrated how
much of the code is affected by it.

Don't know who it added, but yes, the above is what it does when it's
expanded. I did some profiling with a trivial invalid syscall and
trace_hardirqs_off() shows very prominent there, while with the approach
I have in my entry series which does:

       lockdep_irq_off();
       enter_from_user_mode();
       __trace_hardirqs_off();

The tracing overhead goes down by ~ factor 2. That's a lot.

Steven, you're not really serious about this, right? This is tinkering
at best.

We have code pathes which are not necessarily covered in regular
testing, depend on config options etc.

Have you ever looked at code coverage maps? There are quite some spots
which we don't reach in testing.

So how do you explain the user that the blind spot he hit in the weird
situation on his server which he wanted to analyze crashed his machine?

Having 'off limit' sections allows us to do proper tool based analysis
with full coverage. That's really the only sensible approach.

That's nice but does not solve the problem.

The point is that you have something like this:

section "text.offlimit"

nmi()
{
        do_fragile_stuff_on_enter();

        offlimit_safecall(do_some_instrumentable_stuff());

        do_fragile_stuff_on_exit();
}

section "text"

do_some_instrumentable_stuff()
{
}

So if someone adds another call

section "text.offlimit"

nmi()
{
        do_fragile_stuff_on_enter();

        offlimit_safecall(do_some_instrumentable_stuff());

        do_some_other_instrumentable_stuff();

        do_fragile_stuff_on_exit();
}

which is also in section "text" then the analysis tool will find the
missing offlimit_safecall() - or what ever method we chose to annotate
that stuff. Surely not an annotation on the called function itself
because that might be safe to call in one context but not in another.

These annotations are halfways easy to monitor for abuse and they should
be prominent enough in the code that at least for the people dealing
with that kind of code they act as a warning flag.

Thanks,
