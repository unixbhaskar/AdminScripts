I didn't say you couldn't run a conference for this low, I was just
point out what Plumbers currently costs.  FOSDEM clearly manages in
Europe for free, but what they have to give up is huge: No
tea/coffee/lunch/breakfast at all.  Doing it in a University helps with
A/V, and venue rental, but you're severely constrained by their
timetable (Ethan Miller did offer us UC Santa Cruz one year for LSF/MM
but we eventually concluded that date constraints and logistics would
just be too difficult).
