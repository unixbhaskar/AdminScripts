The idea is that rcu_barrier() waits for callbacks from all earlier
call_rcu()s to be invoked.  So as long as you know that the call_rcu()
happened earlier than the rcu_barrier(), the rcu_barrier() is guaranteed
to wait for that call_rcu()'s callback.

In this case (and Jens will correct me in the sadly likely event that
I get the story confused), we have a call_rcu() followed by scheduling
work on that same task.  The work has to start executing after it was
scheduled, so if that work does an rcu_barrier(), then that rcu_barrier()
will wait on the call_rcu()'s callback to be invoked.

Jens could invoke the rcu_barrier() just before scheduling the work,
but the synchronous delay from the rcu_barrier() is a problem.

Jens, what did I mess up in the above story?  ;-)

I defer to Jens and Tejun on the possibility of ending up with all
workqueue kthreads waiting on rcu_barrier().  If that is a problem,
there are some ways of dealing with it, though none that I can think of
that come for free.

							Thanx, Paul
