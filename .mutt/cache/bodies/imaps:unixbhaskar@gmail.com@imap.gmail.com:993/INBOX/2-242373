Absolutely agree with this.  We have a big meta pattern here where we
introduce functions with tortuous semantics then someone creates a
checker for the semantics and misuses come crawling out of the woodwork
leading to floods of patches, usually for little or never used error
paths, which really don't buy anything apart from theoretical
correctness.  Just insisting on simple semantics would have avoided
this.

Well, the semantics of kobject_init() are free on fail, so these are
the ones everyone seems to be using.  The semantics of kobject_add are
put on fail.  The problem is that put on fail isn't necessarily correct
in the kobject_init() case: the release function may make assumptions
about the object hierarchy which aren't satisfied in the kobject_init()
failure case.  This argues that kobject_init_and_add() can't ever have
correct semantics and we should eliminate it.
