Pretty much so.

That's why I think a section approach is more practicable.

That and in some places in the entry code we do the heavy weight
operations to cover 100 instructions which turn on RCU anyway. That does
not make any sense at all.

In a quick test I did with a invalid syscall number with profiling the
trace_hardirqs_off() is pretty prominent and goes down by roughly a
factor of 2 when I move it past enter_from_user_mode() and use just the
non RCU idle variant.

Haven't tried that yet for the overall usage of trace_hardirqs_off(),
but yes, it's going to be a measurable difference.

Right, but that still does the whole rcu_irq dance especially in the
entry code just to trace 50 or 100 instructions which are turning on RCU
anyway.

That might happen, but we'll see how much of that is truly
requried. It's not horrible large. For the int3 isolation most of it was
fixing up code which should have been protected in the first place and
the only copied code was bsearch which is tiny.

That works as long as none of this uses breakpoint based patching to
dynamically disable/enable stuff.
