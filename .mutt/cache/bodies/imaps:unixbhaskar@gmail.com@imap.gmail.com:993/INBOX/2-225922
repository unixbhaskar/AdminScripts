Yes, I took this from the i915 Kconfig.  It's temporary, in 5.7 I am
planning to get it to just !KASAN, but for 5.6 I wanted to avoid more
breakage so I added the other restrictions.  The difference between
x86-64 and i386 is really just the frame size warnings, which Christoph
triggered because of a higher CONFIG_NR_CPUS.

(BTW, perhaps it makes sense for Sparse to have something like __nostack
for structs that contain potentially large arrays).

I did that and I'm also adding W=1; and I threw in a smaller than
default frame size warning option too because I don't want cpumasks on
the stack anyway.  However, that wouldn't help contributors.  I'm okay
if I get W=1 or frame size warnings from patches from other
contributors, but I think it's a disservice to them that they have to
set KCFLAGS in order to avoid warnings.

Yes, and GCC prereleases are tested with Linux, for example by doing
full Rawhide rebuilds.  If we started using -Werror by default
(including allyesconfig), they would probably report warnings early.
Same for clang.

I hope that Linux can have -Werror everywhere, or at least a
CONFIG_WERROR option that does it even if it defaults to n for a release
or more.  But I don't think we can get there without first seeing what
issues pop up in a few subsystems or arches---even before considering
new compilers---so I decided I would just try.
