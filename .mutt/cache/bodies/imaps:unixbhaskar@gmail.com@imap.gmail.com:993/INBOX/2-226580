Yes, currently. However, v5.7+ will have a cgroup2 mount option to
propagate protection automatically.

It's incomplete and more brittle in that the kernel has to treat a
large portion of memory usage as essentially memlocked.

CPU control isn't but IO is. Without working IO isolation, it's
relatively easy to drive the system into the ground given enough
stress ouside the protected area.

What's DAMON?

Yes, right now, memory.low needs to be configured all the way down to
the leaf to be effective, which can be rather cumbersome. As written
above, future kernels will be easier to work with in this respect.
