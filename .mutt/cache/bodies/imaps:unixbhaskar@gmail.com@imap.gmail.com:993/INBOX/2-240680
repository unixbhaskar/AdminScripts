Turns out that wasn't the real problem here, the culprit is the
lib/test_printf.c code trying to tear down a kobject tree from the
parent down to the children (i.e. in the backwards order).

I don't like rebasing or changing the HEAD like that on a public branch.
As proof, syzbot started sending me a bunch of "this is the failed
commit" messages right after your email, based on it's testing of the
tree in linux-next.

What is really odd now, is that 'git log lib/kobject.c' does not show
the change/revert at all.  Is that because there was a revert?  Or is it
a git config option/default somewhere that prevents that from showing
up?

Odd, 'git blame lib/kobject.c' doesn't show it either.  Yet e6764aa0e553
("Revert "kobject: Make sure the parent does not get released before its
children"") is in your tree.  What am I missing here?

thanks,
