This is a good clarification, no issue with it.

This is however a bit more problematic. I understand the intent, which I
believe is good, but it would make ballot stuffing very easy. At the
same time I understood it will not be an easy task to set clear written
rules that wouldn't be over complex and would still allow reaching the
end goal of expanding the election to the whole community through
electronic voting. I'm afraid I don't have a solution to propose to this
problem at this time.
