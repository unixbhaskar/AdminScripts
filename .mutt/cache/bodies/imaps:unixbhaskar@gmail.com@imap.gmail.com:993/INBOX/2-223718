Why are there so many "RFC" series here?  I treat "RFC" as "I don't
really like this patch but I'm throwing it out there for others to look
at if they care".  No RFC should ever go on beyond a v1 as obviously you
think this is good enough by now, right?

Also, I almost never review RFC patches, we have enough "real" patches
to review as it is :)
